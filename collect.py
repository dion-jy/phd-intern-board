# --- Eightfold --------------------------------------------------------------
# The fifth reader, and the one that reaches Microsoft Research. Microsoft was
# recorded ats:none for weeks and the board carried five of its postings, all from
# the aggregator and all North American or European -- while Research Intern roles
# sat open in Singapore, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangalore, unseen.
#
# Its search API refuses us outright ("Not authorized for PCSX", 403), so the board
# cannot be queried. But the site publishes a sitemap of every posting, and the
# slug in each URL carries the title and the location:
#
#     /job/1970393556978904-research-intern-singapore-singapore-singapore
#
# So enumeration is one cheap request and the filter runs on text already in hand;
# only postings that survive it cost a detail call. Both paths are sanctioned by
# their own robots.txt, which disallows everything except /careers and /api/apply.
EIGHTFOLD_MAX_DETAIL = 120
