"""Step 1 — probe candidate job-board slugs against three public ATS APIs.

Existence is decided by response *shape* — type, fields, HTTP status — never by
how many items came back. The failure responses differ per vendor:

    Greenhouse   HTTP 404, or a body of {"status": 404}
    Ashby        HTTP 200 with the plain text "Not Found"
    Lever        HTTP 200 with {"ok": false, "error": "Document not found"}

The Lever one is the trap: that failure body is a dict, so len() returns 2 and a
naive "did we get any items?" check reports two openings for a slug that does not
exist. mistral-ai, together-ai, cohere and adept were all recorded as live boards
that way before this was caught.
