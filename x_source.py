"""Turn an X post link into a manual.yaml entry.

    python x_source.py https://x.com/msraurjp/status/2090645729052418108 ...

Small research labs and big-tech research groups routinely announce an internship
in an X post and nowhere machine-readable. There is no automated route to those:
the v2 API needs a paid tier to search, Nitter is dead, and the timeline
endpoints rate-limit immediately. One thing does still work unauthenticated --
X's own embed endpoint for a *single known post*:

    https://cdn.syndication.twimg.com/tweet-result?id={id}&lang=en

So the post cannot be discovered automatically, but once a person has the link,
the text, author, date and outbound links can be read without retyping them.

This is deliberately a one-off helper rather than part of collect.py. The
endpoint is undocumented and could disappear; the daily job must not depend on
it. Run this, check what it printed, paste it into manual.yaml.
